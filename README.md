### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a [Developer Advocate](https://developers.sap.com/) at SAP. 

I've been hacking on SAP enterprise software for more than three decades, and am still enjoying it. I've written books for Oâ€™Reilly and SAP Press, and speak at conferences and meetups around the world, as well as online on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/djadams-qmacro) where I run a regular live coding series called Hands-on SAP dev with qmacro. 

Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/qmacro), subscribe to my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/djadams-qmacro), read posts on my [personal blog](https://qmacro.org), on my [Language Ramblings blog](https://langram.org), and my [current](https://people.sap.com/dj.adams.sap#content:blogposts) & [previous](https://people.sap.com/dj.adams#content:blogposts) profiles on the [SAP Community.](https://community.sap.com).
