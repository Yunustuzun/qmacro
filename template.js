### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a [Developer Advocate](https://developers.sap.com/) at SAP.

I've been hacking on SAP enterprise software for more than three decades, and am still enjoying it. I've [written books](https://qmacro.org/about/#writing-and-talks) for Oâ€™Reilly and SAP Press, and speak at conferences and meetups around the world, as well as online on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/djadams-qmacro) where I run a regular live stream series called Hands-on SAP dev with qmacro.
